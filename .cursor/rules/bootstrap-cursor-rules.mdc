    - Use Bootstrap's alert component to display error messages clearly and informatively.
    - Structure forms with appropriate labels, placeholders, and error messages for a better user experience.

    - Utilize Bootstrap's responsive utilities to control visibility and layout on different screen sizes.
    - Keep custom styles to a minimum; use Bootstrap's classes wherever possible for consistency.
    - Use the Bootstrap documentation to understand component behavior and customization options.

    4.Always follow the rules of Google SEO. For example, when writing code, you need to pay attention to whether the code is conducive to Google SEO crawling. The code should be written in accordance with the rules of Google SEO, and the tags with attributes that are conducive to Google SEO should not be missing.

    3. After completing user requests, always offer suggestions for further optimization and iteration.
